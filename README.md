### About the app

In this project, you can see news across the world according to your category. If you want entertainment news you can easily click on the entertainment button and enjoy. I made this application for my React.Js Project. I used [News Api](https://newsapi.org/) for this project. I cannot deploy this project live because i have taken the developer options for the project. So, I attached the screenshots below so you can easily see how my site looks.
